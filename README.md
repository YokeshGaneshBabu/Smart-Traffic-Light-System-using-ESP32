# 🚦 Smart Traffic Light System using ESP32

A real-time smart traffic control system that dynamically manages traffic lights based on **vehicle speed**, **pedestrian requests**, and **emergency overrides**.

---

## 🧩 Features
- Measures vehicle speed using **ultrasonic sensors (NewPing library)**.
- Dynamically switches traffic lights:
  - **Fast vehicle → Red light**
  - **Medium-speed vehicle → Green light**
  - **Slow vehicle → Red light**
- **Pedestrian crossing** trigger using push button.
- **Emergency override** sequence for priority vehicles.
- Modular design for future integration with **AI, Computer Vision, and IoT**.

## 🧠 Working Principle
1. **Vehicle Detection:**  
   Ultrasonic sensors detect when a vehicle passes the first and second sensors, calculating travel time.
2. **Speed Evaluation:**  
   The time difference between sensor triggers determines whether the vehicle is fast, medium, or slow.
3. **Traffic Control:**  
   Based on speed, LEDs switch accordingly.
4. **Pedestrian & Emergency Override:**  
   - Pedestrian button requests a safe crossing.
   - Emergency switch activates a priority sequence (Red → Yellow → Green).

## 🧾 Code Overview
The main functions:
- `handleEmergencySequence()` – Controls emergency override sequence.
- `controlTrafficBasedonSpeed()` – Dynamically controls lights using sensor data.
- `measureTravelTime()` – Calculates travel time between sensors.
- `resetAllLights()` – Turns off all LEDs.
